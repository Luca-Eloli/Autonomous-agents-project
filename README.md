# Autonomous-agents-project

This repository contains the autonomous agents coursework project I worked on in 2021.
It involves recreating a popular puzzle known as 'Light-up' within PDDL architecture.
Online examples of the puzzle can be found here: https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/

domain.pddl contains the domain file for the light-up puzzle, and the two problem files 
contain each an example of a puzzle that the planner aims to solve. 

for this project, the planner fd-stripped was used
